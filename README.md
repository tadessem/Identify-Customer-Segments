Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Project Motivation
This is the third project of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.

File Descriptions
There is one iPython notebook to showcase work related to this project. The html file was generated from iPython notebook to submit this project.

Results
Cluster 4 is overrepresented in the customers data compared to general population data. Some characteristics of the group of population that are relative popular with the mail-order company:

in areas where the share of 6-10 family homes is lower (PLZ8_ANTG3=1.73)
in Prosperous or Comfortable households (WEALTH=2.75)
in life stage of Families With School Age Children or Older Families & Mature Couples (LIFE_STAGE=3.30)
Cluster 13 is underrepresented in the customers data. Some characteristics of the segment of the population that are relatively unpopular with the company:

in areas where the share of 6-10 family homes is higher (PLZ8_ANTG3=2.44)
in Less Affluent or Poorer households (WEALTH=4.4)
in life stage of Pre-Family Couples & Singles or Young Couples With Children (LIFE_STAGE=1.98)
